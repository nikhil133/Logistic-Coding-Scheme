# Logistic-Coding-Scheme
Text Classifier which classifies the product to its category and sub categories group based on predicted product code using naive bayes multinomial classifier

# Packages needed
pickle

sklearn

numpy 1.19.3

pandas 1.1.4

nltk 3.3

# How to
Compile item-code.py to train
Compile predict-item.py to predict
csv file should be of the form item-codes-sample.csv
.pkl file is generated from train python code, Its needed for prediction
Category dictionary is created according to given information please free to rectify and train accordingly by changing csv target values(class_code)
